# My Windows 11 Pro 25H2 tweaker.
Just some basic registry tweaks, noting fancy like obliterating edge.
You can use it but dont ask for support.

Run it by pressing Windows + R and typing in:

powershell -Command "iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BluamekGD/windows_tweaker/refs/heads/main/windows_tweaker.ps1 | iex"
